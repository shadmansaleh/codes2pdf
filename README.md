# codes2pdf

Auto generate a PDF notebook from your source codes (useful for your ACM-ICPC cheatsheet)

## Dependencies

This generator works in both Linux and Windows, so check how to install TeX Live in your OS.

TeX Live for linux:

    sudo aptitude install texlive

TeX Live for Windows:

    download installer (install-tl-windows.exe) from https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html

Also install the <u>latest version</u> of Node.js and NPM on your machine (you can download them from https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After installing Node.js on Linux, add this command to your ~/.bashrc:

    export PATH="$HOME/.npm_modules/bin:$PATH"

## Install

    sudo npm install -g https://github.com/shadmansaleh/codes2pdf

## Update

    sudo npm update -g https://github.com/shadmansaleh/codes2pdf

## Use

    Usage: codes2pdf <source_dir> [options]

    Auto generate a PDF notebook from your source codes

    Options:

        -V, --version               output the version number
        -a --author [name]          author's name to be added in the notebook
        -i --initials [initials]    initials of the author to be placed in the upper-right corner of all pages
        -I --institute [institute]  name of the institute to be placed in the center
        -o --output [filename]      output file for the notebook. Default to `./notebook.pdf`
        -h, --help                  output usage information

example:

    codes2pdf ./ /tmp/team_reference.pdf
    codes2pdf ./ --author "TEAM_SBU" --initials SBU --institute "Shahid Beheshti University"

The second one will create a 'notebook.pdf' file in the current directory, from the source code files which are located in the current directory and its subdirectories.

The notebook generator will add your source code with syntax highlighting, additionally
you can add .tex files which will be rendered as Latex code.

## Sample PDF

Here you can find a sample: https://github.com/shadmansaleh/codes2pdf/blob/master/sample_notebook.pdf

(In this forked version of the original repository, the generated notebook file will have three columns in each page with a smaller font size; so you can put more source codes in a few number of pages for ACM-ICPC contests.)

## Notes

- Try to use up to 3 "levels" in your source code.
- Use spaces insead of underscore (in the filenames) to print a prettier TOC.
- In this forked version of the [original repository](https://github.com/pin3da/notebook-generator), the generated notebook will have three columns in each page with a smaller line spacing. This is useful when you have a large number of different source codes and there is a limit on the number of pages for creating a cheatsheet.
- The original repository was created by [Manuel Pineda](https://github.com/pin3da/) and [Diego Restrepo](https://github.com/Diegores14).
